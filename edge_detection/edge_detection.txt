Edges represent sharp changes in intensity (or color) in an image.
These changes often correspond to object boundaries, textures , or other key features

Sobel Filter
--------------
The sobel filter detects edges in horizontal and vertical directions by calcuating gradients.
Beloe filters mathematically mirrors the derivate operation.

Laplacian Filter
-----------------
Laplacian detects edges by finding regions of rapid intensity change .
Unlike sobel , it combines x and y direction derivatives in a single operation

The laplacian kernel below is a discrete approximation of this continuous mathematical
derivative. Below filters mathematically mirrors the derivative operation.

Canny Edge
The canny algorithm detects edges using multi-step processing ,
combining sobel and thresholding techniques

Step 1   : Convert to grayscale because edges are present in color change information not in colors
Step 2   : Apply Gaussian Blur which adds smoothness to image it less sensitive to small color
           change variations
Step 3.1 : Compute intensity Gradients using Sobel operator to approximate the first derevatives in    
           x and y-directions
Step 3.2 : Calculate magnitube but we also need angle of the edge and we can get using:

            thita = arc tangent(Gy/Gx)


Step 4 : Non-maximum Supression.

        -> For each pixel , compare the gradient magnitude to its two neighbour along the gradient direction
        -> if pixel'sgradient is not the largest , supress (set to 0).

Example : 
      Gradient direction : 45 degree
      compare G(x,y)------->   G(x+1,y+1)
                  |
                  |-------->   G(x+1,y-1)


Step 5 :  Double thresholding
          -> High Threshold : Pixels above this are string edges.
          -> Low threshold  : Pixels below this are supressed entirely.
          -> Pixels between the two thresholds are classified as weak edges.

                  High threshold = 100
                  Low threshold = 50

                  G  > 100   :  Strong edge
                  50 < G  <= 100    :  Weak edge
                  G <= 50 : Supressed (Not an edge)


Step 6 : Edge Trackiong by Hysteresis
          ->In this final step , weak edges are either kept or discarded based on their
             connectivity to strong edges.
          ->If a weak edge is connected to a strong edge, it is retained else discarded.

Canny combines several techniques (Gaussian blue, Sobel, thresholds) to ensure edges are
clean and noise-free.
