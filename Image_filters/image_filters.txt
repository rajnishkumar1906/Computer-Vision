""" Convolution operation """

A image filter is a set of rules that we apply to an image to extract or emphasize certain features
Filter :
    1. Sharpens
    2. Smoothens
    3. Enhances
Filter depends on kernel , which is a 3*3 or 5*5 or N*N matrix 
which determines how filter operates

Filter is name of filter and kernel is a matrix.

Filter and kernel are slightly different.

3*3 kernel known as horizontal filter.



Image = 5*5
kernel/filter = 3*3
stride = 1 (stride is no. of step movement)
output_dim = 5-3+1 = 3 (e.g., 3*3)



pixel intensity ranges 0 to 255

if pixel < 0 => set clip to 0
if pixel > 255 => set clip to 255

MIN-MAX Normalization
Vnew = ((V - min)/(max-min))*255 gives output iin range -1 to to 1

Filter is  responsible for extracting edges and

-1 -1 -1   ----> value1 = low
 0  0  0   ----> value2 = neutral
 1  1  1   ----> value3 = high

low + -n-e-u-t-r-a-l- + high ---> Big value means presence of horizontal edge 
                      ---> 0 , no horizontal edge
