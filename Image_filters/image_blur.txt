Blurring is a technique which reduces the sharp transitions in an image by averaging pixel values in a local neighbour.

Blurring(average)
1. Reducing noise
2. Smoothing images

Blurring ---> Average blur  -> Each pixel in the output image is the average of the surrounding pixel within the kernel window.

 |  Gaussian blur -> Gaussian blur uses a weighted average , where pixels closer to the center have more influence. 
 |                   This produces a smoother and more natiral blur
 |                    (for quality blurring)

Median Blur -> Median blur replaces each pixel with median of the surrounding pixels , 
               effective at removing salt and pepper noise
            (to reduce more noise)
